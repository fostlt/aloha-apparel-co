# Aloha Project
My first website project for a fictional clothing company.

## Objective
Create a basic one page website for a fictional clothing company called Aloha Apparel Co .

## Contains 
Basic HTML, CSS, and JS

## Problems 
I think it would of been better if I remade the site with mobile first in mind. It got too tricky trying to 
figure desktop to mobile. I will end up probably trying to remake the site with that in mind. Next time I will have more foresight on the naming scheme.

## Final Thoughts
I think it's okay for a first time website, but I now know how to avoid bugs for my next iteration on this site.
