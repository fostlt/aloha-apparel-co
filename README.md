# Aloha Apparel Co
Aloha Apparel Co is my first website I made with Red Academy. The main idea behind it was to learn basic html, css, and some js.

# What did I learn?
After finishing this website I got a basic grasp on how to structure a website with the idea of mobile first design.

Learning flexbox and grid was it's own challenge, I still have a long way to go learning CSS. 

Diving into JS was scary, but it opens up new ideas of what I can possibly make in the future.
